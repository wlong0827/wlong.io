				Will is the Founder and CEO of Numinar Analytics, a political campaign tech startup building an AI-powered targeting and omni-channel voter contact system to win elections. After coding the initial platform from his college dorm, he went on to raise $1 million in funding, sign over 30 campaigns across the country from senate to city council races, and send millions of texts, calls, emails, and mailers in their first year. Before Numinar, he spent extensive time in Silicon Valley first building Machine Vision models for Amazon's Go stores and then at Palantir helping win their first USDA and $800M DCGS-A Army contracts. A recent graduate of Harvard, he studied one of the first Joint Concentrations in Computer Science and Government, writing a Hoopes prize-winning, summa cum laude senior thesis on the application of Hobbes's political philosophy to problems of cooperation in Artificial Intelligence. In his spare time, he enjoys debating Catholic social teaching, rooting for Tottenham Hotspurs, and extolling the virtues of his home state of Oklahoma.
